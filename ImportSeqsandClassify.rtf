Required files: 
1) ASV table produced through R metabarcoding diet analsyis script (InsectCOI_asv_table1.csv), these are sequences that need to be assigned to taxa
2) reference database and marker gene speciic trained classifier (bold_anml_classifier.qza)

#from original ASV table (InsectCOI_asv_table1.csv), create new csv file with 2 columns: 1st column is ASV1-ASVn (n = number of sequence variants), 2nd column is ASV's pulled from ASV table
#convert newly created csv (InsectCOI.csv) to fasta
awk -F , '{print ">"$1"\n"$2}' InsectCOI.csv > InsectCOI2.fas

#cd into directory containing the sequences that need classification and the classifier (or cp or ln the files)
#once youve installed qiime2 and created a qiime2 environment, activate it using the environmentâ€™s name:
conda activate qiime2-2022.2
#to deactivate
#conda deactivate

#import the fasta file generated from ASV file
qiime tools import \
--type 'FeatureData[Sequence]' \
--input-path InsectCOI2.fas \
--output-path Insects2.qza

#assign taxonomy to the unknown insect COI seqs using the pre-trained, locus-specific classifier 
#"The raw BOLD sequences were initially filtered for ambiguous nucleotide content (5 or more N's), long homopolymer runs (12 or more), very short (< 250 bp) or very long (> 1600 bp) sequences, and dereplicated."
#this is a primer-trimmed COI database, specific to the ANML primers we used for bat diet analysis. The ANML primer set is specific to arthropods, 
#we COULD filter even further, e.g., for taxa such as class insecta, but I did not.
#(info on trimming reference sequences based on primer set is in note "training a qiime classifier")
